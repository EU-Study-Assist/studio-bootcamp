## Getting Started

### Objective

The objective of this module is to ensure that you have all the necessary tools and setup to begin your journey with R.
By the end of this module, you will:

-   Have R and RStudio installed and configured on your computer.
-   Be familiar with the RStudio interface and its key features.
-   Understand basic R syntax and commands.

You are expected, to have finished following the instructions below before class starts

### Installing R and RStudio

To get started, we need to acquire our copy of R and RStudio.
Both software are free to download and use.

**Installing R** To install R language, you need to download the right software for your operating system.

-   Windows Users: [Click on this link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.4.1-win.exe) and install the downloaded file.

-   Mac Users: The R language software is having 2 different downloads based on your Mac OS processor.
    -   [For M1-3 Apple silicon processors](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.4.1-arm64.pkg) 
    -   [For older intel macs](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/base/R-4.4.1-x86_64.pkg)

-   Linux Users: Open your terminal from applications or use the shortcut `ctrl + alt + t` to open it anywhere. Download and install R based on your linux distribution:
    -   Debian distro: type in or copy the code below:
``` {.bash .terminal}
#| eval: false
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev
```
    -   Redhat/Fedora distro: type in or copy the code below:
```{.bash .terminal}
#| eval: false
$ sudo dnf install R
```

-   The RStudio Interface:
